/**
 * This exception is thrown by linux when the pthread implementation tries to lock a robust mutex which
 * WAS locked by another process or thread that has died before releasing the mutex.
 *
 * If this exception is thrown then the mutex is locked successfully and must call unlock.
 * However, before unlock is called the thread should call pthread_mutex_consistent if the locked data is in a consistent state.
 * If pthread_mutex_consistent is not called then after unlocking every further attempt to lock() will fail.
